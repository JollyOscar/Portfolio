                <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
                <p class="s-bio"> I'm Alex Gamble, a passionate web developer based in Truro, Nova Scotia. I love blending technical skills with a creative flair, and I always strive to create user-friendly applications. I'll admit, my projects often come with a side of sarcasm, which keeps things engaging and entertaining.</p>

                <p class="s-bio"> When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in the epic, challenging world of video games, especially 'Dark Souls.' Those games not only fuel my creativity but also inspire my problem-solving skills—after all, if I can survive that game, I can handle just about anything! </p>
                    
                <p class="s-bio"> Family is incredibly important to me, and my lively daughter keeps life interesting. Between battling tough bosses in video games and navigating the challenges of parenthood, there's rarely a dull moment.</p>
                    
                <p class="s-bio"> I believe in continuous learning and growth, and I approach each new project with enthusiasm. Whether it's developing web applications or exploring intricate game mechanics, I put my heart into everything I do. With humor at the core of my work, I aim to be a pleasure to collaborate with and a valuable asset to any team.</p>
                    
                <p class="s-bio"> In short, I'm not just a developer; I'm a creative thinker, a proud gamer, and a dedicated family man, ready to tackle challenges with a smile and a quick wit!</p>
